### Maven
 * In order to build data-prep, you need libraries only found on Talend's Nexus (from Data Quality team). Refer to [maven/settings.xml](/maven/settings.xml) for sample settings.

### IntelliJ idea
 * Install [Eclipse Code Formatter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546) plugin
 * Import the java formatter file [tooling/IDEs/intellij/format.xml](/tooling/IDEs/intellij/format.xml)
 * Set the order import manually as followed `java;javax;org;com;`

That's it, you're good to go !

### Eclipse
_Coming soon... (whenever a new team member uses eclipse ?)_
